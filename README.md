# The Grate Machine

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.8.

## Game description
This is a puzzle game where you are presented with a 10x5 board with steam machines on the beginning and the end of the board.

You own a company that makes grates and your goal is to connect the starting steam machine with the ending steam machine while connecting all of the grate machines on the way (as they produce the grates).

## How to play

Use the mouse to play.

Clicking a tile places the selected pipe onto the grid.
Mouse wheel rotates the pipe in the way you want.
In case you make a mistake, there is an undo button.

Alternatively, you can use keyboard shortcuts.

* 1, 2, 3 - Select an item from the inventory
* Q, E - Rotate the pipe counter-clockwise / clockwise
* R - Rotate the pipe
* M - Mute the music
* U - Undo last move

Start from the starting steam machine on the left side and work your way through the level by connecting the starting steam machine to the ending steam machine and any grate machines in the way.
Connecting the steam machine to the grate machine generates grates.

Both steam machines and grate machines can be connected by pipes from any direction.
